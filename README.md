🌦️ Neon Weather App
A modern dark neon-themed weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, inspired by real mobile weather apps.
The UI features a dynamic multi-color neon glow, clean black background, and smooth transitions for a premium look.
This project focuses on UI/UX experience + real-time weather data rather than just functionality.
